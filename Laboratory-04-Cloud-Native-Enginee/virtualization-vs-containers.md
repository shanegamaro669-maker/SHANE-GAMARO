# Virtualization vs. Containers

| Category                | Virtual Machines (VMs)                                                        | Containers                                                                                         |

| **Architecture**        | Each VM includes a complete guest operating system running on a hypervisor.   | Containers share the host operating system kernel while keeping applications isolated.             |
| **Boot Time**           | Usually takes minutes because a complete operating system must start.         | Usually takes seconds because containers start only the required application and its dependencies. |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Heavy and requires more RAM and storage because every VM contains a guest OS. | Lightweight and uses fewer resources because containers share the host OS kernel.                  |
| **Isolation Level**     | Provides strong hardware-level virtualization and isolation.                  | Provides process-level isolation between applications.                                             |

Containers are useful for web applications because they can start quickly and use fewer system resources than traditional virtual machines. They allow applications and their dependencies to be packaged together, making them easier to deploy consistently. Containers are also portable and can run in different environments that support container technology. For web applications that need quick deployment and efficient resource usage, containerization can provide practical advantages over using a separate VM for every application.
